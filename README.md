# Constraints Generator

This is a Python script that generates TCL code automatically for constraint
buses.

## Usage

The script is usable in Python explicitly through the command line. First, the
user inputs the bus name, followed by all pins. When the user wishes to stop
entering pins, they may enter `0x0`. The script then automatically generates TCL
lines suitable for copying into Vivado or another editor.

## Why is this heavily object-oriented?

## Why isn't this written in Java?

Maybe it should be written in Java.

## Will you extend this project?

No.

In all seriousness, feel free to submit a PR.
